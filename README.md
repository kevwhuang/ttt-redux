# Capstone Project Description
> **AudioWarsâ„¢** is a song-matching game where the player pairs a song preview to its title within 15 seconds. The song list is generated from either playlist submission or uploaded then tagged by the player. The frontend is built using Bootstrap 5 to be modern and minimalistic. The backend stores song databases, which is instanced per player. Players that create an account and authenticate may log their gameplay history and statistics to view and share with friends. Settings are available to customize gameplay parameters, as well as display themes and layout options. The web application utilizes Spotify and YouTube APIs to download track information, as well as node audio packages to manipulate the playback. Current challenges include effectively filtering metadata, converting uploads into streamable formats, determining preview selections, and managing file spaces. Additionally, there is potential legal liability with copyright infringement. Options for further development include implementing local and global multiplayer modes, as well as improvements to the game design.
